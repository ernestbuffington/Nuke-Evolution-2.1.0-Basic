                              MOO PUBLIC LICENSE
                          Version 1.0, Oktober 2005

Copyright (c) 2005 The MOO Dev. Group. All rights reserved.

Preamble
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share
and change it. By contrast, the MOO Public License is intended to guarantee
your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is
free for all its users. You can apply it to your programs, too.
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our
Public License is designed to make sure that you have the freedom to
distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),
that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change
the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you
can do these things.
We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2)
offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
and/or modify the software.
Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that
everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the
software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to
know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced
by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.
Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish
to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually
obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent
this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's
free use or not licensed at all.
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
follow.

1. REDISTRIBUTION

   You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works
   thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or
   Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

   a. You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a
      copy of this License; and

   b. You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating
      that You changed the files; and

   c. You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You
      distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices
      from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not
      pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and

   d. Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright
      notice and the following disclaimer in the documentation and/or other
      materials provided with the distribution.

   e. The end-user documentation included with the redistribution, if any,
      must include the following acknowledgment:

      "This product includes software developed by the MOO Development Group
       (http://moocms.com/)."

      Alternately, this acknowledgment may appear in the software itself, if
      and wherever such third-party acknowledgments normally appear.

   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may
   provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use,
   reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such
   Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and
   distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in
   this License.

2. USE OF NAMES

   The names "MOO" and "MOO CMS" must not be used to endorse or promote
   products derived from this software without prior written permission. For
   written permission, please contact moocms.com. Products derived from this
   software may not be called "MOO", nor may "MOO" appear in their name,
   without prior written permission of the MOO Development Group.

3. MODIFICATIONS

   You may make modifications to the Software and distribute your
   modifications, in a form that is separate from the Software, such as
   patches. The following restrictions apply to modifications:

    a. Modifications must not alter or remove any copyright notices in the
       Software.

    b. When modifications to the Software are released under this License,
       a non-exclusive royalty-free right is granted to the initial developer
       of the Software to distribute your modification in future versions of
       the Software provided such versions remain available under these terms
       in addition to any other license(s) of the initial developer.

4. CONTRIBUTION

   All contributed code is the sole property of the contributer and in case
   it is approved and shipped within this package it will fall under the same
   license, unless the code is a complete non-derivative file with its own
   license.

5. USE OF SOURCE CODE

   In case you want to use parts, not limited to function and method calls, or
   an whole file of the source code in any other application, for the file
   containing the code the following restrictions apply:
   
    a. The file must be released under this License.
    
    b. The license distributed with your software may not conflict in any way
       with this License, in case of a conflict you may not use the code in
       your distribution without prior written permission.

6. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

   Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with
   respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this License is
   intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Distributor
   who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a
   manner which does not create potential liability for Contributors. Therefore,
   if a Distributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such
   Distributor ("Commercial Distributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify
   every Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages
   and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other
   legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor
   to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Distributor
   in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product
   offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or
   Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement.
   In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the
   Commercial Distributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial
   Distributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Distributor in,
   the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified
   Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.

   For example, a Distributor might include the Program in a commercial product
   offering, Product X. That Distributor is then a Commercial Distributor. If
   that Commercial Distributor then makes performance claims, or offers
   warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are
   such Commercial Distributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the
   Commercial Distributor would have to defend claims against the Contributors
   related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires
   any Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Distributor
   must pay those damages.

7. LICENSE VERSIONS

   The MOO Development Group may publish revised and/or new versions of the
   MOO Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar
   in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new
   problems or concerns.
   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
   specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
   "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
   conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the
   MOO Development Group. If the Program does not specify a version number
   of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
   MOO Development Group.

8. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY

   THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND ANY EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES,
   INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
   FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE MOO
   DEVELOPMENT GROUP OR ITS CONTRIBUTORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,
   INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT
   LIMITED TO, PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE, DATA,
   OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF
   LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING
   NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THIS SOFTWARE,
   EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.
