/*****[LICENSES AND CREDITS: README]*************************************
 We have tried to be as diligent as possible to follow all copyright and
 license notices. Included in these folders are all the information that
 should be necessary to correctly give credit to the people that deserve
 credit, as well as state any license(s) or agreement(s) that were
 reached with author(s) or copyright holder(s).

 If a notice was included in a download package or was on the website in
 which the item was downloaded, then we made all attempts possible to
 contact the author(s) or copyright holder(s).  Included are any
 agreements that were reached as well as how these agreements were made.

 If no notice was included in the download package or install files 
 and the website in which the item was downloaded from did not make any
 mention of the item having any other type of copyright or license,
 then it was assumed that the item was released under the GPL license.

 If this was not correct, or you have ANY issues with how any item was
 used in this package please feel free to contact any of the authors
 through any means provided. You may also go to
 http://www.nuke-evolution.com and post or PM any issues you might have.
 We do not wish to use anything in an incorrect or inappropriate fashion
 and will do what ever is necessary to correct any problems.

 Nuke-Evolution Team
